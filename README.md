"# Animal-Crossing-Catch-calander" 
This applet allows people to use the time from their computer (or input their own time if you are into time skipping ;) )
currently it tells you what bugs you can catch right now based off of season, it is based on the Northern hemesphere, and odd timed bugs like the tarantula are not included yet until I come up with a better way to check if those bugs are catchable.


things to come.

•price (Nook prices, after hour prices, and Flick and cj prices)(Fishes)
